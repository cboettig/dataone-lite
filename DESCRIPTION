Package: rdatone
Description: An R package for interacting with the Data Observatory Network of Earth (DataONE) and member repositories, including the KNB, DataDryad, and TreeBASE.  This package uses curl commands to query against the DataONE REST API directly, sidestepping the Java requirements of the existing `dataone` R package.  
Title: R interface to the DataONE RESTful API
