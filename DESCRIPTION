Package: dataonelite
Description: A lightweight R package for interacting with the Data Observatory Network of Earth (DataONE) and member repositories.  This package uses httr-based CURL commands to query against the DataONE REST API directly, sidestepping the current Java requirements of the existing `dataone` R package.  It is meant only as a proof-of-principle and stop-gap implementation during the upgrade of the official `dataone` package; and provides neither a complete API interface or compatibility with the official `dataone` package.
Title: R interface to the DataONE RESTful API
